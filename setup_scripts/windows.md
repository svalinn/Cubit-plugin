Windows Build
=============

Find the Trelis folder, probably "C:\Program Files\Trelis 16.x\"

Copy MOAB.dll to "path\to\Trelis #\bin\" and svalinn_plugin.dll to
"path\to\Trelis #\bin\plugins\".

Ensure that you have a copy of hdf5 installed and in your path.  If you do not,
download from https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html the
distribution built for Windows 64-bit using VS 2013. Copy hdf5.dll into
"path\to\Trelis #\bin\".
